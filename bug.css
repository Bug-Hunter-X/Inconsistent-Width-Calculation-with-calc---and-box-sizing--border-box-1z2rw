The following CSS rule may cause unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px);
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

The issue is the combination of `calc()` and `box-sizing: border-box`. If the parent element has padding or border, the `calc()` function might not account for it correctly, leading to unexpected width calculations.  The `border-box` model includes padding and border in the element's total width.  The `calc()` function calculates the width before `box-sizing` is applied, resulting in incorrect dimensions.
