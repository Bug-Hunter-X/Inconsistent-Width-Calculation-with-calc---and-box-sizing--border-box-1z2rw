To fix this issue, you should account for the padding and border in your `calc()` expression. If the parent element has a specific padding and/or border, adjust `calc()` accordingly.

For example, if the parent has 10px padding on each side and a 2px border on each side, you would need to modify the CSS to:

```css
div {
  width: calc(100% - 20px - 20px - 4px);
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This ensures that the width is correctly calculated including the parent's padding and border.

Alternatively, to avoid complex calculations, consider using a different approach like flexbox or grid layout which handles sizing and padding more intuitively.
